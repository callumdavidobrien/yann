Yet another Neural Network (hopefully at some point)

The hope is to build a simple neural network in Erlang capable of processing
the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). We started this at
Hack Keele 2018, a hackathon at Keele University.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing, let me know me on mastodon
(@cdo@bsd.network), matrix (@cdo:matrix.org) or twitter (@callumdobrien)
and I'll add you as a contributor.

Then pick a card from the "To Do" lane on our project board, and read the
description and comments on the issue. Work on the branch specified in the
issue and on your own fork, and move the card into "In Progress" while you're
working on it. Once you're finished, open a pull request, link to it in the
issue's comments and move the card to the "Pull Requested" lane. From there
it should be reviewed and eventually merged :)

You can also help out by reviewing open pull requests, and filling out cards
in the "Unrefined" lane. Each card needs a description of the work and a
branch name to work on before it should be moved to "To Do".
